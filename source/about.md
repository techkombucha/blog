My name is Tucker Roll and I am a serial enterpreneur, decade-long software engineer, tech leader, international thinkfluencer, global public speaker, accredited expert in Kubernetes systems architecture and the author of the Techkombucha blog. When I'm not travelling South East Asia living my true life as a digital nomad, I spend my time in my hometown San Francisco. Apart from having strong opinions and being very vocal about said opinions online, I'm also a fictional character.

Oh yeah, and you should totally follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/techkombucha).

## About the blog

Techkombucha is a satire tech blog meant to be consumed for entertainment purposes only. Don't do any of the stuff that is suggested on the blog at home or at work. Like, I'm serious.
